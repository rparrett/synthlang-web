# SynthLang-Web

Generates random fantasy / constructed languages

## Inspiration

SynthLang is heavily inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/49x6ry/procedural_language_generator/) by "Snarfilingus."

SynthLang doesn't do a lot of the fancy things that Language Generator does (yet?).
